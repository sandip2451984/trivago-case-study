    "reviews": [
        "This hotel is not only a very enjoyable place, but also has the best food ever. The pool isn't especially very good",
        "I have stayed here 4 or 5 times while visiting LA. Despite travelling all over the world and staying in some of the best international hotels ( for work), Hotel Caliornia is one of my absolute favourites. Perfect location, right on the beach.I love the way you can just open your door and be outside, no elevators, corridors big glass windows. The ambience is so nice, retro perfect. As for the staff, I have had consistently superb service, with much more personal service and attention to detail than is usual in bigger hotels. Service have been exemplary this time but really everyone is terrific. Can't recommend it highly enough.",
        "I was excited to stay at this Hotel. It looked cute and was reasonable. It turned out to be terrible. We were woken up both mornings at 5:45 AM by noisy neighbors. The shower was clogged up...the room was sooooo small we kept tripping over each other. The saving grace was the pool at the Loews next door. I wish we had paid an extra $50 and stayed at a nicer place. This motel should cost no more than $99 a night.",
        "This is not a good hotel to stay in. It is not very bad, but it is not good neither. The food isn't great and the bed wasn't clean. The stay wasn't a nightmare but it was not a good experience.",
        "Terrible. Old, not quite clean. Lost my reservation, then 'found' a smaller room, for the same price, of course. Noisy. Absolutely no parking, unless you luck out for the $10 spaces (of which there are 12). Water in bathroom sink would not turn off. Not hair dryer, no iron in room. Miniscule shower- better be thin to use it!",
        "Found this hotel by reading over tripadvisor while planning a little beach getaway. Really good price by the beach. James the front desk manager was really fun, he made our stay more fun than we thought it would be. We are going to come back with our friends soon."
